You are tasked with writing a smart home appliance control solution. The solution should be able to control various home appliances such as a Light, Fan, and Air Conditioner. Each appliance has its own unique way of being turned on and off.

 

1. Light: The light can be turned off by toggling a switch to the "off" position.

2. Fan: The fan can be turned off by reducing its speed to zero. 0 = off, 1, and 2.

3. Air Conditioner: The air conditioner can be turned off by setting the thermostat to the "off" mode.

## Language

The project will be coded in $${\color{orange}JAVA}$$ and will follow a set of Object Oriented Programming patterns and principles. The project will also be structured following the principles of a clean architecture.
## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) patterns and principles

* Encapsulation: Each appliance hides its implementation details.

* Polymorphism: All appliances are treated uniformly using a common interface.

* Open/Closed Principle: You can add new appliances without changing existing code.
